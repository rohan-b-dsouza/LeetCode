// BruteForce - Approach =>

Step 1: Find all possible permutations of elements present and store them.

Step 2: Search input from all possible permutations.

Step 3: Print the next permutation present right after it.

// T.C => O(N * N!) since total permutations are n! and each is of length n
// S.C => O(N * N!) since an array will be used to store permutations and each is of length n
